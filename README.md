# Go unsafe.Pointer vulnerability POCs

This is a series of proof of concept Go programs showing how the use of `unsafe.Pointer` can lead
to different vulnerabilities. There are four examples in total.

These examples accompany the blog post series [Exploitation Exercise with unsafe.Pointer in Go](https://dev.to/jlauinger/exploitation-exercise-with-unsafe-pointer-in-go-information-leak-part-1-1kga).

Each week I will add the code for the next part of the series. So far, there is only one part:

 1. [Information Leak](https://dev.to/jlauinger/exploitation-exercise-with-unsafe-pointer-in-go-information-leak-part-1-1kga)

This blog posts are written as part of my work on my Master's thesis at the [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/stg/homepage.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt.
